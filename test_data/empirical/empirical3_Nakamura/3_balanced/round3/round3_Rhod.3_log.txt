--- Command used ---
prepDyn(input_file='test_data/empirical/empirical3_Nakamura/1_noPreprocessing/', input_format='fasta', MSA=False, output_file='test_data/empirical/empirical3_Nakamura/3_balanced/round3/', output_format='fasta', log=True, sequence_names=True, orphan_method='integer', orphan_threshold=20, percentile=25.0, del_inv=True, internal_method='semi', internal_column_ranges='all', internal_leaves='all', internal_threshold=20, partitioning_method='balanced', partitioning_round=3)

--- Step 1: Summary before preprocessing ---
No. sequences: 110
No. columns: 313
Total no. nucleotides (A/C/G/T only): 34359 bp
Total no. gaps (-): 33
Total no. IUPAC N: 2

--- Step 2: Trimming (invariant columns) ---
[]

--- Step 3: Missing data identification (gaps replaced with '?') ---
Total '?' characters: 32
Total '-' characters in fully missing partitions: 0
Combined total: 32



--- Step 4: Partitioning ---
WARNING: 'balanced' partitioning with partitioning_round=3 was skipped for this alignment. This typically happens when the alignment has fewer blocks of missing data ('?') than required. The process will continue without partitioning this file.

--- Summary after preprocessing ---
No. sequences: 110
No. columns: 313
No. pound sign columns (#): 0
Total no. nucleotides (A/C/G/T): 34359 bp
Total no. gaps (-): 1
Total no. IUPAC N: 2
Total no. missing values (?): 32
