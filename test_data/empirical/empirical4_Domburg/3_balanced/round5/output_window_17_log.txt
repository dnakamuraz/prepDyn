--- Command used ---
prepDyn(input_file='../test_data/empirical/empirical4_Domburg/1_noPreprocessing', input_format='fasta', MSA=False, output_file='../test_data/empirical/empirical4_Domburg/3_balanced/round5/output', output_format='fasta', log=True, sequence_names=True, orphan_method='integer', orphan_threshold=20, percentile=25, del_inv=True, internal_method='semi', internal_leaves='all', internal_threshold=20, partitioning_method='balanced', partitioning_round=5)

--- Step 1: Summary before preprocessing ---
No. sequences: 14
No. columns: 1000
Total no. nucleotides (A/C/G/T only): 12696 bp
Total no. gaps (-): 1300
Total no. IUPAC N: 4

--- Step 2: Trimming (invariant columns) ---
[0, 998, 999]

--- Step 3: Missing data identification (gaps replaced with '?') ---
Total '?' characters: 1298
Total '-' characters in fully missing partitions: 0
Combined total: 1298



--- Step 4: Partitioning ---
WARNING: 'balanced' partitioning with partitioning_round=5 was skipped for this alignment. This typically happens when the alignment has fewer blocks of missing data ('?') than required. The process will continue without partitioning this file.

--- Summary after preprocessing ---
No. sequences: 14

Total no. nucleotides (A/C/G/T): 12656 bp
Total no. gaps (-): 0
Total no. IUPAC N: 4
Total no. missing values (?): 1298
