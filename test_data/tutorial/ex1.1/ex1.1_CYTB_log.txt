--- Command used ---
prepDyn(GB_input='test_data/tutorial/ex1.1/ex1.1_input.csv', input_format='fasta', MSA=False, output_file='test_data/tutorial/ex1.1/ex1.1', output_format='fasta', log=True, sequence_names=True, orphan_method='integer', orphan_threshold=10, percentile=25.0, del_inv=True, internal_column_ranges='all', internal_leaves='all', partitioning_method='None', partitioning_round=0)

--- Step 1: Summary before preprocessing ---
No. sequences: 10
No. columns: 385
Total no. nucleotides (A/C/G/T only): 3848 bp
Total no. gaps (-): 1
Total no. IUPAC N: 1

--- Step 2: Trimming (invariant columns) ---
[]

--- Step 3: Missing data identification (gaps replaced with '?') ---
Total '?' characters: 1
Total '-' characters in fully missing partitions: 0
Combined total: 1



--- Step 4: Partitioning ---
Method used: None
No partitions were inserted based on the criteria.

--- Summary after preprocessing ---
